# Introduction
In this course you will get familiar with different realms of Artificial Intelligence including Genetic Algorithms, Hidden Markov Models, 
Clustering Algorithms, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning:

Genetic Algorithms -> Finding the answer for backpack problem while satisfying specific asked conditions.
Hidden Markov Models -> Extracting mfcc of sound data and classifying them into 10 classes (10 digits) as task 1 and also classifying them into speaker names as task 2 using HMM models.
Clustering Algorithms -> Extracting Feature vectors out of flower images by using VGG16 model and applying DBSCAN and K_means clustering on them.
Machine Learning -> Implemmenting diverse ML algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble Learning, KNN, and SVM.
Neural Networks -> Extracting word embeddings out of tweets using WORD2VEC model and classifying them into suicidal or non suicidal using Convolution Networks.
Reinforcement Learning -> Training RL models using Q_learning for snake game.
